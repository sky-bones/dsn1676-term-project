			You are trapped. They trapped you. You not sure who they are, but the have cold hands and left the scent of bitter coffee. It’s dim. The light, however faint, comes from a far corner of this…cave. It’s reflecting light in a peculiar way, faceted and sharp. You begin to come back to yourself, feeling around you. Your hand comes back wet and stinging, with the small of copper and salt. Come to think of it, everything smells like salt. As your eyes adjust, you see the way the light reflects from the top of the cave, beams creating a soft, rosy glow. The area above your head is filled with soft, rosy crystal.
			 </p>

			 <p class="kilo gutter unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2"> You hold your hand to your face, and notice the dark seeping liquid. It’s stopped stinging at least. Your eyes continue to adjust, and you notice the flat and smooth area that you occupy. Your skin has taken on a blue tinge, you blood looking darker then it should. It’s hard to look away from the sight. You become aware of a soft drip to your left, which echoes around and around you, and you notice what’s below your edge. A pool of liquid, disturbed by the droplets that fall from above in a circular pattern. At the center of the pool, there lies a skull of some kind. It’s not like what you’ve seen before, it’s missing…missing most of its eye sockets. It only has two. The horns spiral out in a peculiar fashion. </p>

			Something shifts and begins to click. You begin to stand, quiet and ethereal. The clicks stop at the base of the pool and a spindly shape walks into it. All you can see is appendages. It’s strange to look at. You touch the crystal beside you, and your hand clinks softly against it. There are dark, glassy tendrils surrounding your hand. Tapping them with your finger, the surface is hard and armor like. And you can touch the crystals with it. You bite back fear and lay your other hand against a crystal. It stings and the smell of copper fills the air.
			 </p>

			 <p class="kilo gutter unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2"> Something below you tinkles, like glass shards falling. The appendages seem to have moved, startled by the scent of coppery blood. It looks at you. You’re not sure how you know, but it is. And it starts to climb towards you. It’s dark enough that the black shape almost becomes invisible as you panic, your dark glass hands and blue skin unless against this threat. So you jump. You land against hard sharp crystals and liquid shifts against you, gel like and sticky, your left side aches and there’s a blood-forming area of glassy hardness, copper fading. You rip yourself away from the gel and into the maze of razor like rock.  Towards the light. That’s your goal.  </p>

			So you being to run, and your skin is ripped by the crystals, black cold glass slowly forming armor in long tendrils, dripping off your arms and knees and leaving shattered and splintered glass behind you. the sharp clicks behind you increase their tempo, (to be completed)
