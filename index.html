			You are trapped. They trapped you. You not sure who they are, but the have cold hands and left the scent of bitter coffee. It’s dim. The light, however faint, comes from a far corner of this…cave. It’s reflecting light in a peculiar way, faceted and sharp. You begin to come back to yourself, feeling around you. Your hand comes back wet and stinging, with the small of copper and salt. Come to think of it, everything smells like salt. As your eyes adjust, you see the way the light reflects from the top of the cave, beams creating a soft, rosy glow. The area above your head is filled with soft, rosy crystal.
			 </p>

			 <p class="kilo gutter-2"> You hold your hand to your face, and notice the dark seeping liquid. It’s stopped stinging at least. Your eyes continue to adjust, and you notice the flat and smooth area that you occupy. Your skin has taken on a blue tinge, you blood looking darker then it should. It’s hard to look away from the sight. You become aware of a soft drip to your left, which echoes around and around you, and you notice what’s below your edge. A pool of liquid, disturbed by the droplets that fall from above in a circular pattern. At the center of the pool, there lies a skull of some kind. It’s not like what you’ve seen before, it’s missing…missing most of its eye sockets. It only has two. The horns spiral our in a peculiar fashion. </p>
